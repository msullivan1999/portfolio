        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>My name is Matt Sullivan. I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Computing Degree from the University of Sydney.</p>
        <p>I love all things technology, with particular interests in cyber security and software development. I am currently working as a security operations centre (SOC) analyst. That said, within cyber security my main areas of interest lie in application and cloud security. I hope to one day combine my passions for software and cyber security by pursuing a role in either application or cloud security engineering.</p>
        <p>Recently, I have been spending any free time I have learning as many cloud security concepts as possible. I am currently having loads of fun pursuing my Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) certification.
        <p>Outside of work and study, I spend most of my time training to run the 100m. I represent New south Wales (NSW) at a national level in the 100m and have ambitions to one day represent Australia.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my website and learn a bit more about me. If you would like to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>, I would love to here from you!</p>
        <p>Kind Regards,</p>
