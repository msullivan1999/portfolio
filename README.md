# website2.0
Second Attempt at creating a personal website, with more focus on UI Design and HCI theory.

This website is being built to function as a portfolio to present my work. It is also itself forming a part of this portfolio of works.

The website is being built using Adobe Illustrator, PhotoShop, XD, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (the website will be fully responsive) and vanilla JavaScript.
